# Void - Visual Studio Code Extension

Void is a Visual Studio Code extension that helps you keep your sensitive information safe. It automatically hides secret keys, API tokens, and other credentials directly within your editor. This prevents accidental leaks when you're screen sharing, recording demos, or collaborating with others.

## Features

- **Automatic Secret Obfuscation**: Void intelligently detects and hides sensitive information in your open files.
- **Toggle Visibility**: Easily toggle the visibility of your secrets when you need to view or edit them.
- **Customizable Configuration**: Define what patterns to hide and create custom rules for your projects.

*Note: The core features of Void are currently under development.*
